# Alarm Sounds Directory

This directory contains alarm sound files for the Smart Alarm Clock application.

## Default Sound

You can replace this file with your own WAV file, but make sure to keep the filename the same.

## Supported Formats
- WAV files (*.wav)
- MP3 files (*.mp3)

## Adding Custom Sounds
You can add your own sound files to this directory. They will be available for selection in the alarm settings.
